        <h1>Andreas Søvik</h1>

        <p>An experienced Software Developer living in Norway. As a developer I am focused
            on creating stable and high-performing systems for the modern web.</p>
        <p>My current focus at work is high quality software engineering and rapid prototyping on a portfolio of coming generations of very capable 2D/3D software. I believe that always being open to learn something new and helping team members improve is an extremely important part of working on challenging projects in tech. Talented people work well when given autonomy, trust and enough guidance to boost their progress.</p>
        <p>I am currently employed at Autodesk where I am working on the next generation of drawing and analysis tools for building design.</p>

        <p>Implementing core technical parts of modern Web SDKs and frontend tooling used by hundreds of other web
            developers.</p>
        <p>Planning and building popular user-facing products on the web, including some of the biggest online
            publishers in Scandinavia.</p>
        <p>Designing and implementing backend systems used for business-critical tasks.</p>
        <p>Working in teams consisting of a mix of expertise; UX, product managers and engineers. I have also had
